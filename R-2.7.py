#R-2.7
"""
The CreditCard class of Section 2.3 initializes the balance of a new ac-
count to zero. Modify that class so that a new account can be given a
nonzero balance using an optional fifth parameter to the constructor. The
four-parameter constructor syntax should continue to produce an account
with zero balance.
